# Predicting house prices using Linear Regression 
This project aims to predict house prices using Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. Leveraging a dataset containing various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location, the model will be trained to learn the relationship between these features and the price of houses.
##
The repository includes:

# Data: The dataset used for training and testing the model. It typically contains features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and price.
# Code: The Python code for implementing Linear Regression using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
# Jupyter Notebook: A detailed Jupyter notebook explaining the step-by-step process of building the model. It includes data exploration, visualization, model implementation, tuning, and evaluation.
# Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the project, dataset, code structure, and usage instructions.
# Requirements: A requirements.txt file listing all the dependencies required to run the code.
# Results: Analysis of the model's performance, including metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score. Visualizations may also be included to illustrate the predictions versus actual prices.
# Future Work: Suggestions for improving the model, exploring different algorithms, or adding new features for better prediction accuracy.
